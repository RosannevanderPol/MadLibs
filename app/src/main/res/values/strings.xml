    <string name="story">Here\'s how you dance the Monstrosity. Stand with your feet together. Now,
        move your left foot up to the side. Now stamp your right foot 10 times and put
        your hands on your partner\'s shoulders . Next, you both stumble slowly to the right and
        bend your arm backward. For the next eight counts, both of you swim down to
        the left. Next, you and your partner stand back to back and wiggle your nails and
        slap your toes together. Don\'t forget to keep stamping your right foot. Now, face
        your partner again, put your toes together and shout, " aaargh !" Now, lie
        backward and repeat the whole thing 3 times. If you feel that you can\'t learn this dance,
        you can always stamp the next one out. </string>
